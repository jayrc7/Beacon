# Beacon
Beacon is a web-app that allows people to see what's going on around their area and meet new people.
The way it works is a user can write information regarding the event they'd like to do/host and pin it on the map so that others may see the beacon they've placed. If someone is interested in attendnig an event, upon clicking a beacon the details along with the contact info the creator inserted will flash on the screen so that the two parties can arrange meeting up. 

Created with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Here mapping API.
Because of the way the mapping API had to be integrated, we have our code in the index.html file created in the public folder.
